dynamicTimeTable
================

This is a simple implementation of Time Table Generation

Instructions to use this project : 

This project is configured in eclipse and is a simple implementation, I had done a webUI for this but somehow i have lost it

1) Clone this repository.	
	
2) Import the project in Eclipse ( you can even copy the package into a new project if you use a different IDE / If import of Eclipse project doesnt work well with that IDE )

3) Set up your requirements in the ```'Initialization.java'``` class, which is very self explanatory 
	
4) Run the ```'TimeTableMain.java'``` file and you will see a ```'timetable.csv'``` file created in the Project Directory

Cheers !

PS : Contributing back to this project will be appreciated, I have stopped working on this project and i would'nt be providing any support for this :)

Good Luck !
